        <h2>Steps To Make Tabakmazz</h2>

        <li>Combine the ribs in a large skillet with a pinch of salt and the cayenne, fennel, ginger, turmeric, bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, milk, and about 1/2 cup water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the mixture simmers; cook, turning the meat occasionally, until tender, adding more water if the mixture dries out, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the ribs are tender, remove them. If any liquid remains in the pan, cook over medium-high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen any bits that have stuck to the bottom, until the mixture is just about dry.</li>
        <li>Remove the cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the pan over medium heat and when it's hot, brown the ribs. Remove the ribs to a warm platter and add about 1/2 cup water to the pan.</li>
        <li>Once again, cook over medium-high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen any bits that have stuck to the bottom, until the liquid is reduced by about half. Pour over the ribs, garnish with cilantro, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
